<p>As a computer programmer I am not suprised I would enjoy the Logical/Mathematical portion of this project the most. I like to organize things into categories and recognize patterns. This flowchart identifies the key features of certain problems and then will go on to show how to solve them.</p>

<h3 id="markdown">Flowchart</h3>

<p>Below is the flowchart I created to determine what derivative to use for an equation, and how to use each one. . .</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes">Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are 3 important intelligences that are a part of this project. Logical, Linguistic, and Visual. The most important is the Logical portion. This flowchart shows the general outline of a program designed to determine and solve derivatives. Through a series of boolean statements and conditionals, you can reach the end of the flowchart and use the method described to solve your derivative.</p>
<p>Another part of the project is the Visual/Spatial portion. As this is a flowchart, it has a robust way of showing the flow of logic from one statement to another. Flowcharts like these are used every day in software development to help visual learners plan and code.</p>
<p>The final part of the project is the Verbal/Linguistic Intelligence portion. After determining the derivatives with the conditional statements, one must follow the instructions detailed to solve for the derivative. In the flowchart there is a verbal explanation of how to solve for many of the different derivative rules.</p>
